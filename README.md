### Setting
Copy `sample-config.json` to `app-config.json` and tune it up.

To determine Telegram room parameters, follow the procedure:

1. Create a bot according to [Telegram documentation][bots-docs]
2. It's essential to **disable** [Privacy mode][privacy-mode] to make the bot to
   observe all messages in the room
3. Manually add a bot to the room (using Telegram's invite functionality)
4. Send a message to the bot **directly**, e.g. `/my_id @bot_user_id`
5. Visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_api_key>/getUpdates` and extract
   `"chat"` object from there. E.g.

   ```json
   {
       "id": -1001054401089,
       "title": "bimo_test",
       "type": "supergroup"
   }
   ```

## FAQ

**Does it support bridging more than one room with a single bot?**
 - No, it's not yet supported
 
**What types of Telegram groups are supported?**
 - The bot supports ordinary groups as well as supergroups.

**The bridge only works XMPP -> Telegram, not Telegram -> XMPP.**
 - Check the bot privacy settings, then remove the bot from the Telegram chat, and invite it again.

**I can't find any id from my room when I go to `https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_api_key>/getUpdates`**
 - Sometimes the reply to this request is empty, keep on trying.
